MatchEngine only takes in clubs
Manager and Player subclasses of Person
Manager signs player rather than club?
Manager needs name

player.rating * value / 100

Player has birthday, which means player has exact decimal age and rating changes daily
Player peak rating shifts every day
Player has fatigue attribute which starts at 0, goes up a certain amount after a game, and then gradually falls daily. Fatigue affects game rating
and injury likelihood

GLobal knockout - two separate comps, one set of leagues, one knockout, contained under one class
Make sure fatigue is working, injuries too
Make sure best teams are in top division, worst teams in bottom
DONE - Value of a goal / assist should not be set in stone - should either be higher if fewer goals in the game, or higher if fewer goals separating the teams
Player form!

Home away boost -  DONE

Have added player form in but need to make sure it's working properly and also that form and fatigue are taken into account in both
the actual generation of the score and the player report generation

Dynamically work out when national cup should finish and schedule fixtures back from this point, rather than forward from start of year

Use deque rotate to schedule round robin e.g. have deques for home slots and away slots, rotate one with -1 as argument and the other with 1 as argument,
but remember to always insert first value into home slots. So maybe something like...
from collections import deque
homeSlots = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
awaySlots = deque([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20])
firstFixtures = zip([homeSlots, awaySlots])
homeSlots.remove(1)
homeSlots.rotate(1)
awaySlots.rotate(-1)
homeSlots.insert(0, 1)
secondFixtures= zip([homeSlots, awaySlots])


Top ranked teams in group stage drawn against second ranked teams
Inferior Universal Tournament

Group stage player statistics not included in overall tournament statistics

Managers should be able to select different formation

Player predicted goals and predicted assists should be based on team predicted goals for and not actual goals for if this is not the case
Square root offensive and defensive boosts?

Reduce assist negative when players have scored? Maybe not

Bring base ratings closer together and provide points for result


Have changed goalscorers / assisters in match report, make sure all fine
Check preliminary stage in universal tournaments working


I should remove getPlayerGoalLikelihood and getPlayerAssistLikelihood in PlayerReportEngine and replace within getPlayerReport with e.g. Team.goalFactors[player], after passing
team as a parameter into that function. See version in ShallowSim folder for example
